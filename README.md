# Helios Weather Forecast
This website called Helios is a real time weather forecast service that provides weather forecasts across Europe through a interactive map. The name Helios was the name of the sun god in ancient greek mythology.
The purpose of this website is to provide easily accessible real-time weather information in a fun and interactive way across all devices and screen sizes.

### User Stories

#### First Time User Goals




#### Returning User Goals





### Wireframes
I decided to go with three wireframes, for large screens, medium size screens and small screens. Each wireframe contains two main sections, one with an interactive map and the other with weather forecast information such as sunny, cloudy or rainy weather, expected temperatures and so on.

The wireframes were created using - [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). 

The wireframes for this website can be found [here](https://dennischmielewski323696.invisionapp.com/freehand/Helios-Weather-Forecast-bgy1wmerW)
