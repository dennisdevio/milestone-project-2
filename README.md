# Helios Weather Forecast
This website called Helios is a real time weather forecast service that provides weather forecasts across Europe through an interactive map. The name Helios was the name of the sun god in ancient greek mythology. I chose the name Helios because it seemed quite fitting.
The purpose of this website is to provide easily accessible real-time weather information in an appealing and interactive way across all devices and screen sizes.

I additionally made a favicon icon for mobile devices

## UX

### User Stories
My goal was to create an appealing and easily comprehensible website design that presents the latest weather forecast information no matter where you are, that is easy to use and works smoothly on all devices. As the data presented can be percieved as somewhat complex I felt it was important to present it in such a way that it is clear and easy to understand no matter who you are and what device you are using.

#### First Time User Goals
- As a first time user I want to be able to easily get the latest real-time weather info about my location wherever I am.
- As a first time user I want to be able to easily get the latest real-time weather info about other locations for my travel needs.
- As a first time user I want to be albe to find all the weather information you provide especially on mobile since my choices for the day or week may be affected depending on the weather.

#### Returning User Goals
- As a returning user I want to know your website is reliable on all devices I might use.
- As a returning user I want the information you provide to be presented in a clear way on all devices I might use.
- As a returning user I want to know the information you provide is relaible and accurate in any given situation.

### Wireframes
I decided to go with three wireframes, for large screens, medium size screens and small screens. Each wireframe contains two main sections, one with an interactive map and the other with weather forecast information such as sunny, cloudy or rainy weather, expected temperatures and so on.

The wireframes were created using - [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/). 

The wireframes for this website can be found [here](https://dennischmielewski323696.invisionapp.com/freehand/Helios-Weather-Forecast-bgy1wmerW)



### Structure
The structure of the website is laid out in such a way that the interactive map is the main feature of the website. The map itself provides information on the name and address as well as weather information of the place the user clicks on. The map data is presented in a modal that pops up when clicked. Additionally, on larger and medium sized screens the current and coming weather information is presented next to the map in two tables. On smaller mobile devices all weather information is presented in tables underneath the map instead. The data presented outside the map is more extensive and is presented in a way where the current weather information is highlighted in a larger size and the coming weather forecast is presented below that in a smaller size.

### Design
To create a pleasant "light and airy" feel of the website the color theme is white and the font color is a type of gray rather than a standard black font color. The headings font style is set to 'Noto Sans KR' and the paragraph text font style is set to 'Open Sans' which both contribute to that light and airy feel I was after.

Furthermore the logo is an animated sun which I think adds to that light and happy feeling and the name of the website comes from the sun god in ancient greek mythology which I found quite fitting to go with the theme.

To make the website responsive I initially set out to use CSS Grid but after running into problems with it and not fully understanding it yet, I decided to go with Bootstrap instead to be able to meet the deadline, since I have prior experiece with it.


## Features
- Responsive Design across all device sizes, including a hamburger menu button on smaller screens.
- A map that shows local weather information for the locaction you click on.
- Additional weather data that is presented below the map when clicked.
- A favicon that can be used as an app icon on mobile devices. Take a look here.

#### Features Left to Implement

The following features will be implemented on a future release

- A searchbox where the user can input their location of choice, either a country or a city, to get the weather information that way in addition to clicking the map.
- A contact form with the option to send an e-mail to the weather service.
- A dark mode button or slide to provide the option change the white background to a softer color.
